Talkidz Ontology v1.0

The Talkidz Ontology is designed to support the development of applications that assist speech therapists in diagnos-
ing and treating speech disorders. It was developed through a participatory approach involving speech therapists, ontology
engineers, and clinical researchers. Its structure was validated through a survey of domain experts assessing the relevance of key classes and competency questions. Additionally, we demonstrate a real-world clinical application, showcasing the ontology’s ability to facilitate epidemiological studies, and support evidence-based decision-making. By providing
a standardized, expert-validated resource, the Talkidz Ontology aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of speech therapy practices.
 It serves as a crucial step toward improving knowledge sharing and datadriven research in the field of language disorders.
